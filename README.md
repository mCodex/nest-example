# NestJS Example

My sample NestJS project featuring:

- TypeORM
- PostgresSQL
- Docker
- Docker Volumes to persist database into project's folder

## Running

First of all make sure you have docker installed on your machine and then run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

After that you will be able to log in into your database. A default database `nestjs_sample` will be automatically created.

You can use any SQL client software application that supports PostgresSQL
